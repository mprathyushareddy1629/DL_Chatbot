Today he is considered the 'father' of the Toyota Production System, which inspired lean manufacturing in the United States. At the time, Toyota was struggling to compete with the American car market. So, Toyota looked at how other supply chains handled fulfillment by matching inventory levels with consumption patterns. This research led Toyota to see consumer demand as part of the manufacturing process — a required input precedent to production. Ohno aimed to eliminate overproduction by introducing new inventory only when absolutely necessary. Factories were reorganized so that parts production and assembly happened at the same rate, with assembly workers taking parts only as needed. They called it the 'just in time' (JiT) method — but more on that later."
