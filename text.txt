feed forward neural network with 2 layers
used pytorch / also there us with tensorflow

training of data
1. bag of words -> converting evrything to an array 
                    hi, how are you, bye
            hi     [1,0,0,0,0] (0) greeting
            how    [0,1,0,0,0]

            bye    [0,0,0,0,1] (1) goodbye

                       x        y 

FEED FOWARD NEURAL network


  x      sentence            number of patterns      no.of classes       softmax         y
        (bag of words)  


tonenization-> splitting into meaningful units

                hi, how r u?-> [ hi, how, r , u,?]

stemming -> generate the root form of the words , "mostly chops of the ends off pf words"

                organize, organizes, orgainizing
                [oragn,organ,organ]


                NLP preprocessing pipeline 


                hi, how r u?
                | ->tokenize
                [hi,how,r,u,?]
                |  -> lower+stem
                [hi,how,r,u,?]
                |   -> exclude punctuation characters
                [hi,how,r,u]
                |   -> bag of words
            x->    [1,0,0,0]


use a framework -> NLTK toolkit

1. activate virtual venv.
2. install/ activate pytorch  -? pip install torch
        torch version -> 2.1.2+cpu

3. install nltk  -> pip install nltk
        open nltk_utills.py and continue

        punkt -> a package with pre trained tokenizer.
